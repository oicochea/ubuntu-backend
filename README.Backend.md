### Link: https://outreach-zen.herokuapp.com/

### Ubuntu is an application that allows users to sign up and log in to thier account to create, view, update, and/or delete community projects in thier area.

### User Stories 
- Outreach create route adds your new project
- Update route by _id
- Delete route by _id 

### Technologies Used 
- Mongoose
- Express
- Postman

### Approach Taken
- Tech lead = Leanne
- Findby, Create, Update, and Delete routes
- Create seed data to serve as projects that render once you enter your zipcode
- Used 2 models: The first model is used to create an outreach event to be added, including the impact/cause, project title, location of project, etc. The second model is used to create your profile that includes sign up/log in functionality. 
- backend was built by Brandon and Oscar

### Unsolved Problems
- - Pulling from Google Map API in order to auto populate location when creating a new event

### Improvements for Later
- search local projects from home page without logging in
- search input to search by zip code
- incorporate Google API
